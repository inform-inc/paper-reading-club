## Introduction

I started a paper reading meeting every week for the past month in the Palo Alto office. I have loved our discussions so much, I would like to extend this over to the rest of our team. Each week, I choose a moderator to choose the topic and a paper and send out details Monday. On Wednesday we have our discussion around noonish PST.

Paper reading is an informal discussion around a piece of writing, may it be an academic paper or a popular blog post. Topics have included password hashing and how Word2Vec works. There is no powerpoint, no live coding, and no formal lectures.

Let me know if you're interested. I will send you an invite to our calendar event. This week, Ayush will be moderating a discussion around "Serverless Architectures" based off the blog post of the same name on Martin Fowler's website.
