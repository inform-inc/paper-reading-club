## Introduction

This week's paper is a random selection. It's as random as a human can extract random from a pile of papers.

Here's the title:  
"Simple Testing Can Prevent Most Critical Failures: An Analysis of Production Failures in Distributed Data-intensive Systems"

> We found the majority of catastrophic failures could easily have been prevented by performing simple testing on error handling code – the last line of defense – even without an understanding of the software design.
> We extracted three simple rules from the bugs that have lead to some of the catastrophic failures, and developed a static checker, Aspirator, capable of locating these bugs.

We can overlook the Aspirator tool and extract out the nuggets, I think. Or yell at me on Wednesday.
