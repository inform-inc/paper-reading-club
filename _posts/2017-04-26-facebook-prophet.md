## Introduction

We're finally doing the paper from Facebook.

Facebook released a paper last month about creating forecasting services at scale.

Abstract:

> There are a variety of challenges that come with producing a large number of forecasts across a variety time series.
> Our approach to forecasting at scale is a combination of configurable models and thorough analyst-in-the-loop performance analysis.
> We present a forecasting approach based on a decomposable model with interpretable parameters that can be intuitively adjusted by the analyst.
> We describe performance analysis that we use compare and evaluate forecasting procedures, as well as automatically flag forecasts for manual review and adjustment.
> Tools that help analysts to use their expertise most effectively enable reliable forecasting of a large variety of business time series.
