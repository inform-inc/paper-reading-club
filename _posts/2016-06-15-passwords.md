## Introduction

Theban and I have been throwing around the idea of a paper reading group. We were going to start it two weeks ago, but thanks to IEEE, the papers were behind a paywall :(

Since everyone's back from holiday, I thought it might be fun to read a paper and discuss it. What I'm proposing is we take turns selecting one paper to read/skim/gloss over/etc. and discuss it at the end of the week. Since most folks are here on Thursday, would it be interesting to do this?

Example papers/blog posts:
- [Enough With The Salts: Updates on Secure Password Schemes](https://www.nccgroup.trust/us/about-us/newsroom-and-events/blog/2015/march/enough-with-the-salts-updates-on-secure-password-schemes/)
- The Log: What every software engineer should know about real-time data's unifying abstraction
- How to build static checking systems using orders of magnitude less code
- A Neural Network in 11 lines of Python (Part 1)

We ended up reading the paper on salts and passwords.
