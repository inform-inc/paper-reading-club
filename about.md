The Inform Paper Reading club is a collection of people who like to read technical papers and really like to discuss them.

The papers we choose to read are typically computer systems related, but not always. We meet once a week, or so, at Inform Palo Alto. We usually wait until everyone gets lunch.

This blog is mostly to keep notes on papers we have read. Tweet at @newsinc if you have ideas or feedback. Thanks!

## Code of Conduct.

Donâ€™t be a jackass.

## Inspiration

The concept comes from an [episode of Ruby Rogues](https://devchat.tv/ruby-rogues/243-rr-books-that-arent-poodr) where @jessitron talks about having a paper's reading club at work.
Also inspired by the @papers-we-love [Meet-up Group](http://paperswelove.org/).
Website idea from @nylas.
